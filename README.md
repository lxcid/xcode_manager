_Work in Progress_

***

Xcode Manager provides a framework for writing automated tasks for managing Xcode projects.

It builds upon the works from the open source communities, list below in alphabetical order:

- [Shenzhen](https://github.com/nomad/shenzhen) by [Mattt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt)
- [VersionKit](https://github.com/CocoaPods/VersionKit) by [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods)

As these projects are developed often with a slightly different goals as ours, Xcode Manager aims to bridge the remaining gap.
